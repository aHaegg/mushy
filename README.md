# Static web app in Azure
A static web app for Azure with a React frontned (static web app) and a node.js backend (managed api). Both parts with Typescript.

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps in minutes. Use this repo with the [React quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=react) to build and customize a new static site.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
